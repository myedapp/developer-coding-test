# MyEd Developer Coding Test

## Introduction
This is my submission for the myed developer coding test.

I have tried to keep this project minimalistic without the results being overly simplistic. I chose not to format the data in a simple table layout in an attempt to do something more impressive. I hope that this also convinces you that simpler layouts are within my ability.

Before beginning work on the challenge I worked out how I would structure this submission to make assessing it simple; I hope that this proves evident.

This is the first time I have used bootstrap (it's nice!) and so styling the page likely took an excessive amount of time, which is partly why I submitted separate commits for functionality and styling, each with their own time estimate (~2 hrs and ~5 hrs respectively).

## Tools Used

##### Angular 4 with Typescript
Chosen for my familiarity with it and its applicability for the myed position. I have made effective use of directives, bindings, and interpolation.

##### Bootstrap 4 and [ngx-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap)
I opted to use a styling framework for this project as my website is already styled without any frameworks. This was my first time using bootstrap or ngx-bootstrap.

##### PHP and WAMP
I wrote a simple PHP script to act as the file server. I have tried to write it in an extendable fashion to show that it could easily be used to serve other files and file types.

## Running the Production Build
- Begin execution of your preferred virtual server software (I use WAMP).
- Ensure that Apache and PHP 7x are running.
- Pull this repo into the root of your `www` / `htdocs` folder.
- Open a browser and go to [http://localhost/myed-code-test/dist/index.html](http://localhost/myed-code-test/dist/index.html)

---
## Compiling the Source Code
- Run `npm install` on the `developer-coding-test\project` directory.
- Open the `developer-coding-test\project` folder in your preferred IDE.
- Use the Angular CLI to serve/build the project as you like.
