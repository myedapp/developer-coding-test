# MyEd Coding Challenge

## Info
Me: **Dan Brownrigg**

Language: JavaScript, React, Node

Source Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/danbrownrigg/myEdCodingChallenge)

### Instructions
I reckon it might be best to run it with WebPack Dev Server :
1. install Node (8.9.3 LTS) and Git (If you haven't already)
2. clone the GitHub repo or download it from GitHub or get the branch
3. *npm install* from the cloned repo (cross fingers, then wonder about yarn)
4. Go To the *API/* directory and run *npm install*
5. Run *npm start* to start the http server.
6. Got To the Project root and run *npm start* to run the app/page in dev mode (or *npm run build* if you're feeling adventurous)
This should open open up your default browser at localhost:8080

### Notes
\* **TODOs (I'll try to get some of these done, maybe this evening ):**
1. Unit Tests - (I know you love them apologies)
2. Beautify WebPack Config (it's a bit gross)
3. Add Search Component. (Dang! I wanted to do this)
4. More media queries
5. More catches and error handling
